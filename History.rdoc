=== 2.0 / 2015-10-19

* 1 major enhancement

  * Added Minitest::AssertionTests to assist with testing newly added
    assertions, even for other gems. Previously, a variant of what is provided
    was present in +test/minitest_config.rb+.

* 2 minor enhancements

  * Made the expectation +must_be_between+ ready for the next version of
    Minitest by calling +assert_between+ on the test context (+ctx+) rather
    than on the bare object under test. Because of this change,
    minitest-bonus-assertions is now tested for compatibility only with
    minitest 5.8 or higher.

  * Added +assert_set_equal+ and +refute_set_equal+ (with expectation forms of
    +must_equal_set+ and +must_not_equal_set+) to test enumerable values for
    set equality.

* 1 minor bugfix

  * The documentation for +assert_between+ was unclear; it is a
    boundary-exclusive test, not a boundary-inclusive test. That is, it is
    <tt>lo &lt; exp &lt; hi</tt>, not <tt>lo &lt;= exp &lt;= hi</tt>.

* 1 governance change

  * This project now has a {Code of Conduct}[Code-of-Conduct_rdoc.html]
